# Monoalphabetic-Cipher

This repository contains an implementation of the **Monoalphabetic Cipher** that generates a **random substitution key** every time it runs. It is a simple but effective encryption method where each letter in the plaintext is replaced with a randomly shuffled version of the alphabet.

## Features
✅ Generates a new random encryption key for every execution.  
✅ Encrypts and decrypts messages using the generated key.  
✅ Written in Python with a simple and efficient implementation.  
✅ Outputs the key so that the message can be decrypted later.  

## How It Works
1. A **randomized mapping** of the alphabet is created for encryption.
2. The reverse of this mapping is used for decryption.
