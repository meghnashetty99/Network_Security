# Ceasers-cipher
This repository contains a Python implementation of the **Caesar Cipher**, a simple and widely used encryption technique that shifts the letters of a plaintext message by a fixed number of positions in the alphabet.

## Features
- **Encrypts and decrypts** messages using the Caesar Cipher method.
- **Supports both uppercase and lowercase letters** while maintaining the original case.
- Non-alphabetic characters (e.g., spaces, punctuation) are **preserved** during encryption and decryption.
- Customizable **shift key** for encryption.

## How It Works
The Caesar Cipher shifts each letter of the plaintext by a specified number of positions in the alphabet:
- **Encryption:** Each letter is shifted forward by the key value.
- **Decryption:** The letters are shifted backward by the key value to reverse the encryption.
